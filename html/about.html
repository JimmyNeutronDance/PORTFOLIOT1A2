                <h2>Wait, but why web development?</h2>
                <p>After trialling a couple of careers, I stumbled upon my brother doing some front-end code for his employer's web app and I fell in love. I begun learning on Codecademy.com before deciding that a bootcamp with Coder Academy would put me in the best position to be a useful developer to a future company. Nothing worse than buggy websites; never thought I'd be fixing the problems myself!</p>

                <h2>Previous Life</h2>
                <p>I was previously studied a bachelor of business at Monash University. I then pursued a gap year in Central Australia (2019) as I was unsure what I wanted to do. After this period, I decided to become a financial counsellor and undertook study for that career. I was employed in this role by the Salvation Army for one year in Shepparton. I am thankful for my prior experience and I feel it has positioned me well for a career of problem solving and creativity. </p>

                <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
                <p>In my spare time, I enjoy socialising with friends, listening to a good podcast, all kinds of music, watching the footy and beginning to work on my own software projects.</p>
                <p>Now that I am back in Melbourne, I am exploring new interests such as skating and improv.</p>
