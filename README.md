## Description

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to build a website to engage with employers and show an overview of Oliver Wong's credentials as a future web developer. The goal is for this website to illustrate clearly the capabilities of the web developer to an employer (the target audience), but it has also proven to be a useful learning exercise for the project creator's HTML & CSS skills. 

### Functionality/Features

The website primarily promotes a responsive functionality and has been tailored to a mobile-first approach. This is to assist the upscaling of the website design. The website has 4 main branches, all which feature their own distinct elements. 

#### HOME: 

The homepage has a navigation bar at the top which has been made using a flexbox. The logo has been constructed from CSS styling within the flexbox and links back to the index page on any part of the website. 

The profile photo has a box shadow and the titles of the webpage have been indented as well as a bouncing dot on all titles on each page created using keyframes in CSS.

There are social links which have hover effects and link to their respective sites as per the SVG icons.

Lastly, there is a footer that displays the copyright symbol.

#### ABOUT:

The About page aims to tell the employers a little about the author's experience, skills and hobbies.

The text is divided up into paragraphs that sit between photos. These photos are sized using vh/vw and the text used is Roboto font; quite universal for the whole document.

#### BLOG:

The Blog page is used to show employers how the creator can manage a user's story if they wished to view authored content accompanied by pictures.

The images on the the page are sized according to relative proportions and flexboxes have been made within the image to allow text overlays with links to their pages. 

The user can hover over the green title text to show that it is a clickable link. 

The blog posts are arranged in a "2 to a row" set up on desktop and will downsize to one per row when a user is on mobile.

#### BLOG EXAMPLES:

The Blog Examples are used to show the target audience how the creator would design user-focused readable content on a variety of viewing platforms. 

The images have accompanying captions and the text is also in the Roboto font for easier reading. 

The title of the blog example is kept in Times New Roman to distinguish a text article.

#### PROJECTS:

The Projects page is used to display a portfolio of future projects that the author hopes to be able to promote to the target audience (employers). For now, stock images and ideas have been used.

Each project shows a title, relevant image, small info text (LOREM) and a individualised repo link to Github (github.com at the moment)

### TARGET AUDIENCE

The target audience for this project is future employers and other developers who may be able to provide feedback for improving the author's code. 

It is important for future employers to be able to see my curent developing ability as well as some basic profiling about me.

Further, it is important for other senior developers to be able to see my code so as to offer advice for improving in any element of the assignment criteria or syntax.

### REVIEW

The author would like to briefly express their thoughts in this section.

> Overall this project was a very enjoyable ordeal that allowed me to increase my developer confidence. I was proud of the fact that I was able to implement ideas that I thought of in my head from the knowledge learnt in just two weeks at Coder Academy. I do have to highlight some areas of improvement however:

- Cleaner code: the code was often messy and convoluted.
- Relative sizing: This was easily my biggest weakness in the entire project. I ended up committing what I could in order to meet the deadline however I think having my time again I would have taken more time to make sure that my elements were dynamically responsive.
- Time Management: I took far too long on elements that excited and/or interested me and as a result the assignment is lacking in critical elements.

### THANKS FOR READING :)
